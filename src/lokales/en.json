  "faq-title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faq1-q": "What is audio normalization?",
  "faq1-a": "Audio normalization is the process of adjusting the volume of an audio file to reach a specific target level. This ensures consistent volume across multiple tracks.",
  "faq2-q": "Which file formats are supported?",
  "faq2-a": "Audio Normalizer supports all common audio formats that can be processed by modern browsers, including MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A, and FLAC.",
  "faq3-q": "Are my files uploaded?",
  "faq3-a": "No! All processing happens completely locally in your browser. Your audio files never leave your device, guaranteeing maximum privacy and security.",
  "faq4-q": "How does silence detection work?",
  "faq4-a": "Silence detection analyzes your audio file and identifies areas with very low volume at the beginning and end. These can be automatically removed to obtain clean audio files.",
  "faq5-q": "Can I process multiple files at once?",
  "faq5-a": "Yes! Audio Normalizer supports batch processing. You can upload and process multiple audio files simultaneously.",
  "faq6-q": "Is it really free to use?",
  "faq6-a": "Yes, Audio Normalizer is completely free and usable without restrictions. There are no hidden costs, premium features, or subscriptions.",
